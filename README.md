# Minimalism
## Characters
- Orange = Basic (walks back and forth)
- Blue = Defender (touching them is knock back)
- Red = Fighter (run at player, touching is knock back)
- Yellow = Coward (Run from player, but slower than player, can fall off platforms)
- Purple = Royalty (found surrounded by blues and reds, text begs for mercy)

## The Fade
When you take the soul of a character, they grey out and "sulk" (move slowly, only back and forth). The process fades their color and particles it over to you.

## Pollito
- Floating Mexican duck in a cloud at the end of the game
- Allows player to quit or restart for different play through
